As part of my research group, I developed a neuromorphic gesture classification system using PyTorch and a specialized 
Spiking Neural Network (snntorch) library. This project involved the recognition of human gestures from raw data 
captured by a neuromorphic event camera (DVS128).

The dataset used for this project is DVSGesture from IBM. 29 subjects are recorded performing 11 classes of body gestures
by a DVS128 dynamic event camera. The dataset contains 1077 samples, each sample being a stream of events for one gesture.

The nature of the data calls for the usage of an SNN, which is similar to an ANN, but aims to more closely mimic how the 
human brain processes dynamic visual information in a time-varying manner.
